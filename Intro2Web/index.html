            We have a thing called attributes that help in identifying elements (like the class attribute as well
            as the id attribute), some attributes are also used to 
            format your element (the style attribute), and some define important aspects of your element
            (the href attribute of an anchor tag or the src attribute of a img tag).

            You have 2 kinds of tags (structurally speaking):
            1.self closing tags like <br/> <img/>
            2.others <a></a>

            you also have 2 kinds of tags (nomencleture speaking):
            1. semantic tags
            2. the rest

            you have two kinds of elements (space):
            1. inline like <span> </span> is your generic inline element
            2. block like <div> </div> is your generic block element
            * block elements, by default, their width is the entire viewport. If you append another element
            beside a block element that element would, by default, be rendered below that element. While span 
            elements are more social, they don't need as much space. they can exist beside other elements as
            long as the space permits. 

            elements vs tags?
            Elements are: <tag> content </tag>
            Tags are: <tag>
            
            head vs header vs heading?
            head - meta data
            header vs heading?
            header - semantic heading
            heading - has 6 levels, these are your: h1, h2, h3, etc. 

            2 ways to present a collection of data in your page:
            1. Lists
                a. unordered lists
                b. ordered lists
                c. description lists
            2. Tables
